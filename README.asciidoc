== JAX-RS Spock Plugin

Provides Spock specification support for the Grails JAX-RS plugin. +
These specification classes were once included in the Grails JAX-RS plugin, but were migrated to this module in order to
make the JAX-RS plugin more agnostic in terms of Grails/Groovy version compatibility.
