== JAX-RS Spock Plugin

Provides Spock specification support for the Grails JAX-RS plugin. +
These specification classes were once included in the Grails JAX-RS plugin, but were migrated to this module in order to
make the JAX-RS plugin more agnostic in terms of Grails/Groovy version compatibility.

=== Which version of the plugin do I need?

For different reasons (versions of Groovy, versions of Spock), the latest revisions of Grails require different versions of this plugin. +
Each series is marked by a suffix describing the supported version of Grails: +

[options="header"]
|=======================
|Supported Grails version|Required plugin version
|2.1.x and below |+$VERSION+-grails2.0
|2.2.x |+$VERSION+-grails2.2
|2.3.x |Bundled with the JAX-RS plugin
|=======================

The lastest available versions are:

* +0.0.1-grails2.0+
* +0.0.1-grails2.2+

=== How can I obtain the plugin?

Edit your project's +BuildConfig.groovy+ file by adding the plugin's dependency declaration:

----
grails.project.dependency.resolution = {
    plugins {
        compile ':jaxrs-spock:$VERSION'
    }
}
